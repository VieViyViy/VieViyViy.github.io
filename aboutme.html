            <h1>Not Much About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a 20 year old CS Major student who unknowingly signed up for an electrical engineering major as well. From this website, we can see that I like anime and in particular Jujutsu Kaisen.</p>
            <p>I'm a Taurus and I like cats, games, and sleep. My family is only me, my mom, and my dad. My dad is Chinese Malaysian and my mom is Chinese Indonesian.</p>
            <p>I chose this major out of curiosity and randomness.</p>
            <p>I don't know what to do and I can't code fast.</p>
